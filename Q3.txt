Q3. Differentiate between unary, binary, and ternary operators in JavaScript. Give examples of each.
Answer:
Unary Operator: It uses only one Operand to perform action.
eg, let a=10;
      a++;
Binary Operator: It uses two Operands to perform action.
eg, let a=1;
      let b=1;
      let c=a+b;
Ternary Operator: It uses three Operands to perform action.
eg,let a=(2==2)?console.log(‘Equal’) : console.log(‘Not equal’).
